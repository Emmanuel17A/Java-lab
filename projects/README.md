# Java Study Group Projects

Welcome to the **Java Study Group Projects** section! Here, you will find Java projects categorized by difficulty: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**.

## Project Folders:

### 1. **Beginner**  
The **Beginner** folder contains Java projects that are intended for those who are new to programming. These projects will help you learn the basics of Java, including syntax, control structures, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

**Projects you will find in this folder:**
- **Hello World** – A basic Java program that prints "Hello World" to the console.
- **Simple Calculator** – A console application that performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **Number Guessing Game** – A program where the user guesses a randomly generated number.
- **Basic File I/O** – A project demonstrating reading and writing data to files.

### 2. **Intermediate**  
The **Intermediate** folder contains Java projects that will help you improve your skills and understanding of more complex concepts such as working with data structures, exception handling, multi-threading, and more advanced OOP practices.

**Projects you will find in this folder:**
- **Student Management System** – A program that stores and manages student information using classes and collections (e.g., ArrayLists).
- **ATM Machine Simulator** – A simulation of an ATM system with login, deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking functionalities.
- **File Handling** – A project that reads from and writes to CSV or text files, handling different file formats.
- **Bank Account System** – A console program that simulates bank account operations like deposits, withdrawals, and balance checking.

### 3. **Advanced**  
The **Advanced** folder contains more complex Java projects that require a deeper understanding of Java. These projects may involve database interaction, GUI development, networking, and concurrency.

**Projects you will find in this folder:**
- **Online Chat Application** – A multi-threaded chat application using sockets, where users can communicate with each other in real-time.
- **Library Management System** – A system that manages a library of books, users, and borrowing transactions, with persistence using a database (e.g., SQLite or MySQL).
- **E-commerce System** – A fully-featured application that simulates an e-commerce website, with a product catalog, user login, and shopping cart functionality.
- **Real-time Weather App** – A Java application that fetches weather data from an API and displays it in a GUI.
