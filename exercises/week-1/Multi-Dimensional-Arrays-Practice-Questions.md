Expected Output:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 

10. Accessing Elements in a 4D Array

Question: Access the element at position {0, 1, 0, 1} in the 4D array from question 9.

Expected Output:

Expected Output:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

12. Iterating through a 2D Array Using For Loop

Question: Write a program to iterate over a 2D array and print each element using a for loop.

Expected Output (for array { {1, 2}, {3, 4} }):

1 2 3 4 

13. Iterating through a 3D Array Using For Loop

Question: Write a program to iterate over a 3D array and print each element using a for loop.

Expected Output (for array from question 7):

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

14. Using For-Each Loop with 2D Array

Question: Write a program to print a 2D array using a for-each loop.

Expected Output (for array { {1, 2}, {3, 4} }):

1 2 3 4 

15. Transposing a Matrix

Question: Write a program that transposes a 2D matrix. For example, transpose { {1, 2}, {3, 4} } into { {1, 3}, {2, 4} }.

Expected Output:

1 3 2 4 

16. Flattening a 3D Array

Question: Write a program to flatten a 3D array into a 1D array. For example, flatten:

{{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}, {{5, 6}, {7, 8}}} 

into {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.

Expected Output:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

17. Finding the Maximum Value in a 2D Array
