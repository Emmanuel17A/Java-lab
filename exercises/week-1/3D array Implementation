**Tic Tac Toe Implementation Assignment**

**Overview**

Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet popular game for two players. It is played on a 3Ã—3 grid where each player uses either the symbol **X** or **O**. Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell of the grid. The goal is to be the first player to align three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all the cells on the grid are filled and no player has achieved this, the game ends in a draw.

For this task, you are required to implement the game **Tic Tac Toe** in **Java** using a **3D array**. This adds a layer of complexity, but also flexibility for future enhancements.

**Task Requirements**

1. **Game Design and Planning (20 Minutes)**
   - Plan the game logic, including how the 3D array will represent the board.
   - Think about handling player turns, checking for win conditions, and managing invalid moves.
   - Organize your approach to alternate between player X and player O.

2. **Coding (1 Hour)**
   - Implement the game where players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on the 3Ã—3 grid.
   - The game should check for a win after every move and declare the winner when three symbols align.
   - If the grid is filled with no winner, declare a draw.

3. **Testing**
   - Simulate several games to ensure the game runs as expected.
   - Test for cases like a draw, a win, and invalid moves.
